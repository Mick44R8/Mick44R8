-😜 event management is what I really like to get into
So not only the DJ on stage all the special effects
The light setup stage setup and then all the extras
That you get in and organise to run at the same time as the horn
While still having to deal with example getting  porter loo's in
Organising the little things to have an event run smoothly weather is the big Day out
Or some girls sweet 16 birthday
Just simplify the job
( My job is to entertain )
As long as everyone's having a good time that's mission accomplished
Sometimes it might be a company saying put a Christmas party on for us you got a budget of this much money to do it
Or that girls sweet 16 birthday we set a price for the event but I always go over and beyond then you would expect
For me it's the look on people's faces and U can just tell it's better than expected
Free example you can have a foam party I like two machines like 44-gallon drums sort of thing that will pump
Washing detergent bubbles flood the dance floor over the top of your heads easy haka do that especially even has nowhere to go
Or on the other hand I could have the veranda you have at the house set up in a way as it becomes a part of my special effects with dry ice
Going over the edges and down the stairs becoming a part of the effects it's self
But won't give too many of my little party tricks away I have many of them
